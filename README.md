# mandelo
Mandelo is a project initially created for a machine learning course at TUGraz. I crawl data from cnbc.com to extract how often a publicly listed company is mentioned in articles per day. I then fetch stockprice data from https://www.alphavantage.co/ via their generous free API. The price data can then be plotted against the media-mention data to visually see correlations. 

I am currently working on: 
  -Detecting structual changes in the daily stock price and number media mentions
  -Refactoring (the current codebase is quite ugly)
  
  
  
I am working on this project simply to learn and play aroung with web crawling / machine learning. I am sharing it in case somebody can take something away from it. Also input is welcome, and I am happy to answer questions if there are any (an I am able to).
